# reactMemoryGame
Memory Game is a fun memory game created with React.js, Redux Toolkits and React Router DOM. The goal of the game is to find all pairs of matching cards before making 10 mistakes. Each card has an image and the player must remember where each pair is located. The game is easy to play and has an intuitive user interface thanks to React.js technology. In addition, the use of Redux Toolkits allows for efficient game state management, which means that the game runs smoothly and without delays. The inclusion of React Router DOM also allows for smooth in-game navigation.

To make the game more exciting, we have replaced the ambient music with sound effects. The sound effects help players stay focused and engaged while playing. Each time a matching pair of cards is found, the player hears a sound effect indicating success. If the player makes a mistake, they will also hear a sound effect to signal their error.

In summary, Memory Game is a challenging and exciting game that tests the player's memory and ability to concentrate. The inclusion of sound effects adds an extra touch of excitement to the game, making it even more fun and entertaining.
